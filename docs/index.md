A C# .NET (dotnet) GRPC client for etcd v3+

## Documentation Sections

### Getting Started

- [Dependency Injection](client-initialization/dependency-injection.md) - Using the client with Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- [Authentication](authentication/index.md) - How to authenticate with etcd

### Core Operations
- [Key-Value Operations](key-value/index.md) - Working with keys and values
- [Watch Operations](watch/index.md) - Watching for changes to keys
- [Lease Operations](lease/index.md) - Working with leases
- [Lock Operations](lock/index.md) - Distributed locking
- [Election Operations](election/index.md) - Leader election

### Advanced Operations

- [Maintenance Operations](maintenance/index.md) - Maintenance tasks
- [Transactions](transactions/index.md) - Atomic operations

## Common Functionality

### Error Handling

Most errors from the etcd client are thrown as `RpcException` with specific status codes that can be handled appropriately:

```csharp
try {
    var response = client.Get("non-existent-key");
} catch (RpcException ex) {
    switch (ex.StatusCode) {
        case StatusCode.NotFound:
            Console.WriteLine("Key not found");
            break;
        case StatusCode.Unavailable:
            Console.WriteLine("Server unavailable");
            break;
        // Handle other status codes
    }
}
```

### Disposing the Client

The `EtcdClient` implements `IDisposable` and should be properly disposed when no longer needed to release resources:

```csharp
// Using statement automatically disposes the client when done
using (var client = new EtcdClient("https://localhost:2379"))
{
    // Perform operations with the client
    var response = client.Get("my-key");
    // ...
}

// Alternative manual disposal
var etcdClient = new EtcdClient("https://localhost:2379");
try
{
    // Perform operations with the client
    var response = etcdClient.Get("my-key");
    // ...
}
finally
{
    // Ensure the client is disposed
    etcdClient.Dispose();
}
```

When using dependency injection, disposal is handled automatically by the DI container.
